            <p>I'm currently studying Software engineering at Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Medellin.
               Also I have been working as a part-time front-end developer at Umoob, an Start Up from the fitness industry.

               Besides studies and work I spend most of my time reading novels and books related with space, and I like to play games.
